## Author's Notes

### Preliminary Thoughts

Technically, I have done this project before. However, at time I was a _total_ novice when it came to OOP. Now I am
seasoned from quite a lot of school work in C++ and Java where I have built some quite complicated projects (relative
to this). As a result, I have a much better idea of what should be made a class and why. Still, this will be valuable practice with Ruby.
