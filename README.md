# Ruby Tic-Tac-Toe

## Objective

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe)'s
curriculum, build a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe application while focusing on Object-Oriented principles.

## Requirements

1. Game should make use of OOP principles
2. Game is to be played via the command line
3. The board should be displayed between turns
4. The Game is to be played between two human players

## Author's Notes

### Preliminary Thoughts

Technically, I have done this project before. However, at time I was a _total_ novice when it came to OOP. Now I am
seasoned from quite a lot of school work in C++ and Java where I have built some quite complicated projects (relative
to this). As a result, I have a much better idea of what should be made a class and why. Still, this will be valuable
practice with Ruby.

### Final Thoughts

Not a whole lot to say. I installed Rubocop and it's pretty nice having realtime style checking. I already knew most
of the things, but there were a few things I learned (such as `frozen_string_literal` and the changes coming to
Strings in Ruby). I could have done more OOP by making the board an Object (and Squares too if I really wanted to go
nuts), but I recently completed a [much more complex project in Java](https://github.com/cody-malcolm/Ataxx) with the
board just stored as a String at the Game level, and it worked perfectly fine, so I knew this would be fine as well. I
suspect I could convert more of the program to using symbols instead of Strings, and that doing such would be more
"Ruby". This is a relatively trivial exercise, though, so I'll just keep it in mind for later projects as I get more
accustomed to Ruby.
